0x09. Island Perimeter
Algorithm
Python

Island perimeter refers to the total length of the outer edges of a connected group of cells, called an "island," within a grid. It's commonly used in programming and mathematics to calculate the boundary length of land cells in a grid, disregarding shared internal edges. This concept is relevant for tasks involving computational geometry, image processing, and game development, where islands represent distinct regions or obstacles.


For example:- cat 0-main.py

#!/usr/bin/python3
"""
0-main
"""
island_perimeter = __import__('0-island_perimeter').island_perimeter

if __name__ == "__main__":
    grid = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]
    print(island_perimeter(grid))

This is a Python script that calculates and prints the perimeter of an island represented by a grid of cells. The island consists of connected land cells (cells with a value of 1) in a 2D grid. The code appears to be using an external function called island_perimeter from a module named "0-island_perimeter."


The script imports the island_perimeter function from the "0-island_perimeter" module.

It then defines a 2D list called grid which represents the layout of land (1) and water (0) cells. This grid defines the shape of the island.

The script checks if it's being run as the main program using the __name__ variable.

Inside the main block, the grid is defined as a 2D array where each row represents a row of the island and each element within a row represents a cell's value (either 0 or 1).

The island_perimeter function is called with the grid as an argument, and its result is printed using the print function.

In summary, this script calculates and prints the perimeter of the island described by the grid using the island_perimeter function. The island_perimeter function is presumably defined in the "0-island_perimeter" module and is expected to calculate the perimeter based on the arrangement of land cells in the grid.

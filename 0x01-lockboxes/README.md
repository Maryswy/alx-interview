0x01. Lockboxes
Algorithm
Python



Lockboxes, also known as the "Lockbox problem" or "Treasure hunt problem," is a common coding challenge or algorithmic problem. The problem involves finding the keys to unlock a set of lockboxes that are interlinked in some way.

Here's a description of the problem:

Problem Statement:
You are given a list of lockboxes, each containing a number of keys and a set of indices for other lockboxes that can be opened with those keys. Your task is to determine if all the lockboxes can be opened.

Input:
The input is a list of lockboxes represented as a Python list of dictionaries. Each dictionary has two keys:

"keys": A list of integers representing the keys inside the lockbox.
"opens": A list of integers representing the indices of the other lockboxes that can be opened with the keys inside the current lockbox.
Output:
The output is a boolean value. Return True if all the lockboxes can be opened, or False if at least one lockbox cannot be opened.

Algorithm in Python:
To solve the lockboxes problem, you can use a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to traverse through the lockboxes and their corresponding keys. Here's an example implementation using a DFS approach:

python code 
def can_open_all_lockboxes(lockboxes):
    def dfs(lockbox, visited):
        if lockbox in visited:
            return
        visited.add(lockbox)
        for key in lockboxes[lockbox]['keys']:
            for box in lockboxes[lockbox]['opens']:
                dfs(box, visited)

    num_lockboxes = len(lockboxes)
    visited = set()
    dfs(0, visited)  # Start DFS from the first lockbox

    return len(visited) == num_lockboxes



Example Usage:

python code 
lockboxes = [
    {'keys': [1], 'opens': [1]},
    {'keys': [0], 'opens': [2]},
    {'keys': [2], 'opens': [0]}
]
print(can_open_all_lockboxes(lockboxes))  # Output: True

lockboxes = [
    {'keys': [1], 'opens': [1]},
    {'keys': [], 'opens': []},
    {'keys': [2], 'opens': [0]}
]
print(can_open_all_lockboxes(lockboxes))  # Output: False


In the first example, all lockboxes can be opened by following the given indices, so the output is True. In the second example, the second lockbox cannot be opened since it has no keys and no other lockboxes can open it, so the output is False.

PASCAL'S TRIANGLE

Pascal's Triangle is a triangular arrangement of numbers named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal. It is constructed in a way that each number in the triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

The triangle starts with a single value of 1 at the top. Each subsequent row is formed by adding a 0 at the beginning and end of the previous row, and then summing the adjacent pairs of numbers from the previous row to generate the numbers in the new row.

Here is an example of Pascal's Triangle with several rows:

            1
          1   1
        1   2   1
      1   3   3   1
    1   4   6   4   1


In the triangle, the numbers on the edges are always 1, while the inner numbers are obtained by summing the two numbers directly above them. For example, in the fifth row, the number 6 is obtained by summing the numbers 3 and 3 from the fourth row.

Pascal's Triangle has various interesting properties and applications in combinatorics, probability theory, algebra, and number theory. The numbers in the triangle have connections to binomial coefficients, combinations, and the coefficients in the expansion of binomial expressions.

Pascal's Triangle is not limited to the number of rows shown in the example; it can be extended indefinitely, generating an infinite number of rows.

PASCAL'S TRIANGLE

Pascal's Triangle is a triangular arrangement of numbers named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal. It is constructed in a way that each number in the triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

The triangle starts with a single value of 1 at the top. Each subsequent row is formed by adding a 0 at the beginning and end of the previous row, and then summing the adjacent pairs of numbers from the previous row to generate the numbers in the new row.

Here is an example of Pascal's Triangle with several rows:

            1
          1   1
        1   2   1
      1   3   3   1
    1   4   6   4   1


In the triangle, the numbers on the edges are always 1, while the inner numbers are obtained by summing the two numbers directly above them. For example, in the fifth row, the number 6 is obtained by summing the numbers 3 and 3 from the fourth row.

Pascal's Triangle has various interesting properties and applications in combinatorics, probability theory, algebra, and number theory. The numbers in the triangle have connections to binomial coefficients, combinations, and the coefficients in the expansion of binomial expressions.

Pascal's Triangle is not limited to the number of rows shown in the example; it can be extended indefinitely, generating an infinite number of rows.

The shebang line and the multi-line comment provide some introductory information about the script and its purpose.

The pascal_triangle function is defined here. It takes an integer n as a parameter, which represents the number of rows of Pascal's triangle to generate. The function returns a list of lists of integers that represents Pascal's triangle.

This code checks if the input n is not an integer. If n is not an integer, it raises a TypeError with an error message indicating that n must be an integer.

Here, an empty list triangle is initialized. If n is less than or equal to 0, indicating an invalid input for the number of rows, the function returns the empty list.

This section generates each row of Pascal's triangle iteratively. It initializes previous as a list with a single element [1], representing the first row of the triangle.

The outer loop iterates from 0 to n-1, representing the row index. For each row, a new empty list rowlist is created.

If the current row index is 0, indicating the first row, rowlist is set as [1].

For other row indices, an inner loop iterates from 0 to row_index, representing the elements in the current row. The loop handles the edge cases (first and last element of the row) separately by adding 0 to handle the missing elements from the previous row.

For elements other than the edge cases, the element is computed by summing the corresponding elements from the previous row previous[i-1] and previous[i].

After the row is completed, the previous list is updated with the current rowlist, and the rowlist is appended to the triangle list.


Finally, the generated Pascal's triangle is returned as the output of the pascal_triangle function. (in return triangle)

To summarize, this code defines a function that generates Pascal's triangle and returns it as a list of lists of integers. It performs input validation, creates each row of the triangle iteratively, and appends the rows to the final triangle list.

The first line is called a shebang and is used in Unix-like operating systems to specify the interpreter that should be used to execute the script (in this case, Python 3). The second line is a multi-line comment that provides a brief description or documentation for the script.


The line imports the pascal_triangle function from the module named 0-pascal_triangle. The __import__ function is a built-in Python function used to import modules dynamically.


Here, a function named print_triangle is defined that takes a triangle as an argument. The function iterates over each row in the triangle and prints it in a formatted way. The ",".join([str(x) for x in row]) part joins the elements of each row with a comma as a separator, converting each element to a string in the process. The format specifier [{}] is used to enclose each row in square brackets for better readability.



The if __name__ == "__main__": condition checks if the script is being executed directly (as opposed to being imported as a module). If it is being executed directly, the code inside the if block is executed.

In this case, it calls the pascal_triangle function with an argument of 5 to generate Pascal's triangle with 5 rows. The resulting triangle is then passed to the print_triangle function, which prints it.

To summarize, this script imports a function for generating Pascal's triangle, defines a function to print the triangle, and then generates and prints Pascal's triangle with 5 rows when the script is executed directly.

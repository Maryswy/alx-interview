0x0A. Prime Game
Algorithm
Python

For example main_0.py
#!/usr/bin/python3

isWinner = __import__('0-prime_game').isWinner


print("Winner: {}".format(isWinner(5, [2, 5, 1, 4, 3])))


This code is a Python script that appears to be importing and using a function called `isWinner` from a module named `0-prime_game`.

1. Shebang (`#!/usr/bin/python3`):
   - The first line, commonly known as a shebang, is used to specify the interpreter to execute this script. In this case, it specifies that the Python 3 interpreter should be used to run the script.

2. Importing the `isWinner` function:
   - The `__import__` function is used to dynamically import a module by its name. In this case, it's importing the `isWinner` function from a module named `0-prime_game`. The `__import__` function allows you to import modules at runtime using a string containing the module's name.

3. Printing the result:
   - After importing the `isWinner` function, the code prints the result of calling this function with two arguments: `5` and `[2, 5, 1, 4, 3]`.
   - It formats the result into a string using the `format` method, and it will be printed as "Winner: {result}", where `{result}` will be replaced with the actual result returned by the `isWinner` function.
